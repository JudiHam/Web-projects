      <h2>christmas beauty haul and reviews!</h2>
      <h5>28.12.2019</h5>

      <p>This Christmas I got so much makeup and other cosmetics that I'm really excited about! 
        I didn't buy all this at once during December though. Since I didn't want to feel too guilty and I knew I wanted to have a lot of nice new makeup on X-mas, I saved most of the 
        things I bought during the fall semester for the Holidays. 
        <br><br>
        There's items that I've been wanting to try for a really long time and others that caught my eye out and about and I couldn't resist getting more spontaneously. </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href=#sdjreview>Sol de Janeiro Carnaval Getaway kit</a></li>
          <li><a href=#missrbtreview>NYX Miss Robot Eyeshadow Palette</a></li>

      <h3 id="sdjreview"><a href="https://www.bangerhead.fi/sol-de-janeiro-carnaval-getaway-fi">sol de janeiro carnaval getaway kit</a></h3>

      <p>I've been wanting the Sol de Janeiro body mist for a while now as I wrote last month <a href="#sdjart">here</a>.
        I was searching for the mist online to find better prices, because the full-sized bottle is around 30 euros on <a href="https://www.kicks.fi/sol-de-janeiro/ihonhoito/vartalonhoito/vartalovoiteet/brazilian-crush-body-fragrance-mist-240-ml">Kicks.fi</a> and I don't want to commit to 240ml of a fragrance I don't know that well.</p>
    
        <p>When I was looking for this product online I came across a new store <a href="https://www.bangerhead.fi/"> Bangerhead.fi</a>, which is originally 
        Swedish but has a website in other Nordic languages as well, and they had a good selection and prices on Sol de Janeiro products. 
        I've also been interested in trying the Bum Bum cream and shower gel, so when I saw the affordable Carnaval Getaway kit with all of these in mini sizes I got really excited!</p>
         
        <div class="cntrimgdiv"><img class="cntrimg" src="images/sdj.png" alt="Sol de Janeiro products"><br></div>

        <h4>price: 22.32 &#8364;</h4>

        <img class="icon icontr" src="images/cash.png" alt="cash icon">
        <p>The kit was really affordable at the time I bought it and now it's even on sale on the website for 20,72 &#8364;. Shipping was 5 &#8364; but still worth it. In another scenario
          I would have ordered more with it, but as you can witness from this post, I had plenty of makeup comming in the mail already around this time. 
          I think it's a surprisingly fair price considering the usual price point of products from this brand. 
          It also came in a cute little bag that is really useful for travel!</p>

        <p>The scent is the same in the three products: pistachio and salted caramel. It's so yummy and warm in my opinion but I will admit that it's pretty strong and some people wouldn't like it.
        It stays on for a good amount of time, which is nice because the scent has a chance to change a bit and adapt to your body. I really love how it smells, especially after a while!

      <p>I saw this when I was supposed to be shopping for just a few makeup items I had used up and I fell in love with the glitter shades especially (top row second and third shade). I noticed right away that the other shades were kind of meh, but the glitter is what I was focused on. 
        <br><br>
        I have also been on the hunt for a cool tone palette for a while, so things aligned and I decided to buy it online. I didn't wanna get it from the store because I could only find it in the gift set, which includes other NYX products I don't like.</p>
      
        
        <p>I ordered this product from another website that was new to me as well, <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.fi/">Lookfantastic.fi</a>. I always do my research when I'm shopping in a new 
        online store, and this one also seemed legit so I went ahead and placed the order with some other products in my cart as well.</p>

        <p>If this product was amaxing I'd consider the price totally worth it. I paid 16,95 &#8364; for it,
           which is a really affordable price for a good eyeshadow palette in my opinion, but this product wasn't that.</p>

        <p>Honestly I expected a bit more from this palette. When I saw it in the store I knew I wanted it mainly for the two glitter shades, but it's ridiculous how sheer some of the shades are. 
          I'll definitely use this palette for cool toned looks in the future, but I'm gonna keep looking for a better option.</p>

          <p>I'm pretty sure the Colourpop Smoke Show palette would have done the job a hundred times better, at an even more affordable price point. 
          For some reason the palette has mysteriously dissapeared from <a href="https://colourpop.com/collections/the-smoke-show">Colourpop's website </a>though and I can't find any information about why.</p>
       
          <h4>swatches</h4>

          <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="missrbtswatch"><figure><img src="images/missrbttop.png" alt="Nyx Miss Robot Eyeshadow Palette Swatches top row"></figure class="missrbtfig"><figcaption>top row from left to right</figcaption></div class="missrbtswatch">
          <div class="missrbtswatch"><figure><img src="images/missrbtbottom.png" alt="Nyx Miss Robot Eyeshadow Palette Swatches bottom row"></figure><figcaption>bottom row from left to right</figcaption></div>
          </div>

          <p>You can see from the pictures that the shades are really sheer and patchy. These swatches have at least 3 layers each because otherwise you wouldn't see anything. They also feel really chalky and the glitters that I like stick mostly to my finger ainstead of my eyes,
             which is super frustrating. I think a glitter glue would be great for this, but I'm not getting one just because of this product.</p>
          
          <p>I really like the color scheme in this palette, but unfortunately the pigmentation of most of the shades suck. I kind of already knew that when I swatched it the first time at the store, but it's worse than I expected. 
          When I used it for my New Year's look I did notice that it's buildable, but not at the level of most of my eyeshadows. I think this would be an okay product for a beginner, because the pigmentation isn't overwhelming and the dark shades won't be hard to blend.</p>
       
          <h4>new year's makeup look with the palette</h4>

          <p>I did achieved a nice look but I had to use a matte black shadow and a silver shade from Juvia's Place palettes to amp up the shadow and get it to look like what I had in mind.</p>

          <div class="cntrimgdiv"><img class="cntrimg" src="images/nylook.png" alt="Nyx Miss Robot Eyeshadow Look"></div>
      
          <p>Thankfully this palette wasn't that pricy though and I enjoy the three shades shimmery shades I mentioned, which is the only reason I'm not completely frustrated and give it 2 out of 5 points.

      <p>I feel like I got a good bargain on this product because Too Faced tends to be up there in their prices. On the other hand, I've never paid more than 20 &#8364; for a bronzer. 
        This was a treat and I think it was totally worth it because I finally got to try a new brand I've heard so much about!</p>

         <p>I absolutely love the packaging and smell of this bronzer! It has such a classy and delicate package, with a nice mirror and a beautifully pressed text on the pan.
          <br><br>
          I've been using the Physician's Formula Butter Bronzer that never fails me for about a year straight now though, so my expectations are high when it comes to blendability. 
          The Chocolate Soleil has really good quality in my opinion, but the first times using it I've noticed some patchiness regardless of what foundation I've used it with. 
          I think it's a typical issue with bronzers and blushes that are more pigmented right away on the first swipe, so I'll keep using it with a lighter hand.
          <br><br>
           If I didn't like it as a bronzer at all I would probably just eat it because the smell is so yummy!

      <p>I got all of the three products on a 30% sale at my Finnish grocery store called K-Citymarket. I didn't keep the receipt but I remember everything was under 10 &#8364;.
         Maybelline is already relatively affordable so with the discount I found the prices to be very affordable.</p>

        <img class="icon icontr" src="images/heart.png" alt="heart icon">

        <p>I wore this on Christmas eve and I was really happy with my makeup otherwise, but I noticed as soon as I put it on that the shade was a couple of shades too dark and yellowy for me.
          I didn't have time to change the foundation so I made it work with a lighter concealer and by blending it lower down my neck than I usually need to. 
        </p>

        <div class="cntrimgdiv"><img class="cntrimg" src="images/xmasmu.png" alt="Christmas 2019 makeup look"></div>

        <p>After wearing this foundation I feel like my pores got pretty clogged, which might be because of the SPF 50. It also didn't give me as much coverage as I expected,
          and the wrong shade gave an even worse first impression. I have many other oundations I would rather reach for, 
          but someday I might be curious to give it another shot with a shade that actually matches me.
        </p>

        <h3>superstay full coverage concealer, shade light 20</h3>

        <img class="icon icontr" src="images/heart.png" alt="heart icon">

        <p>I'm always searching for the concealer that will cover my dark under-eyes the way so many claim to. After seeing some good reviews of this concealer, 
          I've had it on my wish list for months. With the sale I mentioned before going on, I decided to finally try it.
           I hoped for the best but knew the odds were low of this being any different from other "full coverage" products that flop completely.</p>

        <p>I tried this on Christmas eve as well, and was dissapointed at the packaging, shade and formula.
           Right away I noticed that the applicator doesn't grab much product and you have to scoop 
          the sides of the tube if you want more, because the bottle is pretty wide but you don't get as much product inside.
        </p>
        
        <p>The shade was a bit too dark for under the eyes and the formula wasn't full coverage at all in my concealer. But for those two reasons I do think it would be a
           good concealer for me during the summer when I'm tan and prefer lighter makeup.</p>

        <h3>city bronzer, shade medium warm 250</h3>

       <img class="icon icontr" src="images/heart.png" alt="heart icon">

        <p>I've honestly only worn this bronzer a couple of times, but I think it makes a good everyday bronzer.
           It's pretty light even compared to The Butter Bronzer which I find very lightweight, but I think it's buildable. I do wish it had a bit more pigment.
           I'll definitely incorporate this into my daily routine once I empty my current favorites, because it works but I'm just used to more pigmented bronzers.</p>

      <h2 id="hydrogrip">a fight for the milk makeup hydro grip primer</h2>
      <h5>26.11.2019</h5>
      <p>I really want to get deep into the world of primers because I'm still in the progress of finding a combination of complexion products that last and look nice.
      I have combination skin and always look for ways to make my makeup stay on better and longer, so a tacky primer is what I've been on the hunt for for a while now.
      <br><br>
      When Hydro Grip launched and the awesome reviews kept flooding in, I knew I had to try it.
      Especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lilpumpkinpie05">Jackie Aina</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCroDJPcFCf6DBmHns6Xeb8g">Nyma Tangs'</a class="plink">
       reviews convinced me that this might be what I'm looking for.
      <br><br>
      This is one of those products I would love to get my hands on but still isn't available in store or internationally shipped to where I live.
      There are many EU or UK websites such as Cult Beauty that ship to my country, but the problem with Milk Makeup products is that they're not allowed to be shipped outside the UK for some reason.
      <br><br>
      Brazilians have a saying "dar um jeitinho" which translates to "work out a little way". We use it when there is a silly obstacle to something we want to do, 
      but we are convinced that we can find a way around it. So "dar um jeitinho" is what I tried to do.
      <br><br>
      At the end of October my mom was going to the UK, so I asked her if I could order the package from Cult Beauty to where she would be staying so that she could bring it to me. 
      I went ahead and ordered the Hydro Grip primer during the last week of the month. The shipping was supposed to take 2-3 business days. After it was finally shipped on the 31st, 
      I started following the tracking through Hermes' page. 
      <br><br>
      On the 2nd of November I noticed there was a "delay" in my parcel, but they claimed that updates would be made within 24 hours.
      First I thought it was nothing. Then I sent a few emails and before I knew it it had been weeks from the "delay", my mom was on the way back home and no one from Cult Beauty's customer service had answered to any of my messages nor were thee any updates on my parcel. 
      <br><br>
      I finally wrote a dissapointed review on Trust Pilot since I found a bunch of other similar cases and the very next day I  got a response.
      After having to send a few more emails because they weren't organized enough to find the previous ones where I provided them with all the shipping, billing and tracking information, 
      I finally got my answer and it was what I had suspected. They confirmed that Hermes officially lost my package and that was it. The refund is allegedly on it's way but I won't be ordering from them again. 
      It's really unfortunate and surprising because I have many friends who have ordered from them many times with no issues. 
      <br><br>
      If you're someone who doesn't understand the dark world of the beauty industry you're probably freaked out by now by all this trouble I went through to get one thingy and then write a blog post about it failing. 
      I assure you, maybe Karma doesn't like "dar um jeitinho", but I am convinced I will try the primer one sweet day.

    <h2 id="sdjart">sol de janeiro brazilian crush body mist</h2> 
      <h5>26.11.2019</h5>
      <p>I've tried this fragrance in a makeup store called <a href="https://www.kicks.fi/sol-de-janeiro/ihonhoito/vartalonhoito/vartalovoiteet/brazilian-crush-body-fragrance-mist-240-ml">Kicks</a> we have here in Finland and I'm definitely planning on getting it some time, maybe I'll treat myself with it for Christmas. 
        <br><br>
      The scent is pistachio and salted caramel and I noticed it stayed on my clothes for so long! The next day I wore the same jacket when I went out and for the longest time
      I was wondering why my clothes smell so mysteriously amazing. Then I remembered I'd sprayed this on the day before and that's when I decided I'll pay the price to
      smell like that again.
